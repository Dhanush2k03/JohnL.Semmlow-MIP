%Load the x-ray image of the spine, spine.tif, from the MATLAB Image Process- ing Toolbox. 
% Slice the image into four different levels, then plot it in pseudocolor using red, green, blue, and yellow for each slice.
% The 0-level slice should be blue; the next highest, green; the next, red; and the highest level, yellow. Use grayslice.
% m and construct your own colormap. Plot the original and sliced images in the same figure. 
% (If the original image also displays in pseudocolor, it is because the computer display is using the same four-level 
% colormap for both images. In this case, you should convert the sliced image to RGB beforeÂ displaying.)
