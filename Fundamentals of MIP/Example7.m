%Load the image of blood cells in blood.tiff in MATLAB's image files. Convert the image to intensity class and double format.
% Perform the following sliding neighborhood operations: averaging over a 5 by 5 sliding block; differencing 
% (spatial differentiation)using the function, F, above; and vertical boundary detection using a 2 by 3 vertical difference 
% operator. This difference operator subtracts a vertical set of three left-hand pixels from the three adjacent right-hand 
% pixels. The result will be a brightening of vertical boundaries that go from dark to light and a darkening of vertical 
% boundaries that go from light to dark. Display all the images in the same figure, including the original.Also include binary
% images of the vertical boundary image thresholded at two different levels to emphasize the left and rightÂ boundaries.
